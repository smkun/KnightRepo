  {
    "name": "The Magician",
    "past": "Youthful apprenticeship, natural talent that has borne fruit, a spontaneous decision that led to good results, a sudden and unfortunate choice, a childhood rich with opportunity, a change of lifestyle, a change of profession, a rebirth.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Lady aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Tireless: The character's body is naturally more resistant to trauma and fatigue inflicted by blows to their meta-armour. The usual loss of health points when their armour is damaged does not apply (ignore the 1 HP loss for every 5 AP damaged rule).",
    "disadvantage": "Wrathful: The character suffers from piques of anger when in stress-inducing situations (heated debate, failure, witnessing things they cannot stand, and the like). This anger can swiftly manifest as fits of uncontrollable rage. The character's Composure tests when trying to calm down or not give in to angry impulses suffer a 3-die penalty."

  {
    "name": "The High Priestess",
    "past": "A mentor figure, a lie that caused hurt or harm, a lie that led to growth, mysteries revealed, a seeker of the occult, high intrigue, political machinations, a secret kept hidden.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Mask aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Hidden knowledge: The character holds knowledge shared with few others on specific topics. When performing a knowledge check concerning one of the following: occult, secret society, criminal underworld, religious cults, etc., the difficulty (level, not just numerical value) of all Knowledge-based checks is lowered 1 level. This advantage applies to all checks pertaining to the chosen topic.",
    "disadvantage": "Insatiable curiosity: The character's overwhelming curiosity can lead them to take risks and courses of action that may place them or their allies in danger. Once per game session, the GM may use this disadvantage to make the PC focus on a trivial topic or seemingly useless piece of information. The character remains intrigued by the subject of their curiosity for 1D6 hours or until they obtain satisfaction; in the meantime, although it may be no more than a simple distraction, the constant desire to discover the truth of the matter gnaws at their mind and concentration."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Empress",
    "past": "Higher education, very short education, a difficult apprenticeship, a scientist, a mechanic, unusual knowledge, a wide breadth of learning, a lack of knowledge, intense training.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Machine aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Good memory: The character is blessed -- or cursed -- with a memory that registers all information obtained and can recall it at will. Once per game session, they may ask the GM to give them one piece of academic knowledge, a memory, or even something the character may have stumbled across at some point in their life. This information can never be enough to completely trivialise an investigation or solve a mystery on its own, but can and should help in some way.",
    "disadvantage": "Contrary: The character cannot stand others being right, and feels the need to take a contrary stance to theirs even if this means drawing a conversation out for hours or angering the person they are talking with (and their allies). Once per game session, when a character (PC or NPC) makes a statement that can be seen as debatable, the GM may decide that the PC must take the opposite stance. The PC must then attempt to prove the initial statement wrong by any means at their disposal."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Emperor",
    "past": "The fulfilment of a great project, a great project failing at its close, an officer's posting, a horrible boss, a great mentor, long work leading to a position of command, a position of command obtained out of nowhere, enthralling charisma, or a lack of charm.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Lady aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Magnetism: Something in the way the hero moves or speaks seems to draw everyone's attention. The character gets one automatic success to all their Aura based skill checks when interacting with other humans.",
    "disadvantage": "Presumptuous: The PC has a very high opinion of themselves. They sometimes take dangerous courses of action, and their attitude can prove grating. When they speak, they tend to boast of their accomplishments and virtue or strengths. Furthermore, they may have a tendency to try to fight creatures clearly stronger than them. (How severely this affects the PC, and what constitutes a stronger opponent, is up to the GM.)"
  },
  {
    "name": "The Hierophant",
    "past": "Belief, religious practice, a lack of faith, unshakeable sense of right and wrong, a lack of morals, someone who upholds the law, an outlaw, fanaticism, an epiphany, distrust or hatred of the divine.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Machine aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Spiritual fortress: The hero's mind is an impenetrable fortress, a spiritual bunker of sorts. During character creation, they may add 5 points to their maximum and current hope.",
    "disadvantage": "Fanatic: The PC holds some sort of fanatical belief. These beliefs are not necessarily religious; the character may just be an ardent defender of law and order or of a moral code. Whatever their chosen views, they are more than willing to share them -- at length -- and staunchly defend them. There are no specific game mechanics to represent this, but, being a disadvantage, it should be taken into account when roleplaying the character. Bear in mind that while this can make for an interesting character, players should make sure they aren't needlessly unpleasant or confrontational."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Lovers",
    "past": "A powerful love, a lack of love, hyperactive sexuality, abstinence, dilemmas, a painful decision, hesitation leading to disaster, a free spirit, an outlaw, dreams of freedom, an anarchist.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Beast aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Ease: The character's body seems to adapt to whatever they are holding, allowing them to handle weapons and armour with greater ease than most. They can wield a heavy machine gun while swimming fully clothed, and barely notice body armour when moving. In game terms, the PC is unaffected by the heavy weapon trait. Heavy weapons still have to be used with both hands.",
    "disadvantage": "Crude: Either because of their upbringing or following some mental trauma, the character cannot help but add lewd remarks and coarse innuendoes to everything they say. Their singular fixation and rude outbursts can lead to uncomfortable, embarrassing, and outright dangerous situations for them, for their fellow Knights, and for people to whom they are attracted. A penalty of +1 difficulty level applies to all the character's Eloquence and Aura skill checks when communicating with someone whom they find sexually attractive (at the GM and the player's discretion)."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Chariot",
    "past": "A foe turned friend, a resounding success, an easily won battle, a hard-won battle, hatred that becomes love, a sworn enemy, dear friends betraying each other.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Beast aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Confident: The PC is supremely confident in their words and judgment, without boasting or making a great show of it. The character gets one automatic success to all their Eloquence based skill checks when interacting with other humans.",
    "disadvantage": "Sworn enemy: The character has a sworn enemy in one of Avalon's rival organisations. This enemy is a powerful foe (the GM must decide exactly how powerful and influential they are). This enemy will do their best to kill the character, discredit them, hurt their loved ones and allies, and so on."
  },
  {
    "name": "Justice",
    "past": "An administrative posting, a keeper of the peace, a life of predictable stability, a scientist, unnerving stability, drowning in paperwork, having to follow monstrous orders, facing blind justice.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Machine aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Astute: Given their innate logic and common sense, the character is particularly difficult to manipulate. They get one automatic success on skill checks when determining whether they are being used, played, or duped, regardless of the combo of characteristics involved. Furthermore, if this skill check's result is a critical failure, the PC suffers the consequences of a normal failure instead.",
    "disadvantage": "Too cautious: The character's cautious ways sometimes make them act slower than their peers. They aren't being timid, they are simply 'analysing every angle of the situation.' Or so they say. In game terms, when determining initiative the PC only rolls 2D6 (plus any additional bonuses) instead of the usual 3D6."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Hermit",
    "past": "A solitary retreat, closing oneself off from the world, studies that went on for too long, a prolonged coma, a lost love or a lost friend, a long-awaited promotion that still hasn't arrived, a hero left for dead, isolation in a psychiatric ward, imprisonment.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Machine aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Iron will: The character is used to handling their emotions themselves, and know that they do not need to depend on others. Their way of handling their feelings may seem detached and somewhat robotic, but they resist Horror more than most and lose less hope. In game terms, whenever the character suffers damage to their hope, they lose one less point than they normally would.",
    "disadvantage": "Loner: The character is used to living a solitary life and has trouble trusting others. Even Knights from their banner seem unworthy of their full trust. Whenever the character helps another on a skill check, or is helped by another PC, the check's difficulty is raised 1 level."
  },
  {
    "name": "Wheel of Fortune",
    "past": "Life saved by a stroke of intuition, good luck at gambling, an unexpected victory, winning the lottery, unusual instincts, happy coincidences, welcome generosity, a fortunate birth, an accident leading to good things.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Beast aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Lucky: The character is extraordinarily lucky. They seem to succeed when they were supposed to fail, and win when they should have lost. Once per game session the PC may reroll all dice on a failed skill check.",
    "disadvantage": "Misleading hunches: Sometimes the character's unusual hunches and intuition seem to work against them, leading both them and their allies into danger. Once per game session, the GM may decide that one of the PC's skill checks using either Instinct or Acuity automatically fails. This can be decided after the dice roll."
  },
  {
    "name": "Strength",
    "past": "Strength that comes in useful, time spent working out, victory through strength, victory through athletics, a career in athletics, many useful belongings, power granted by owned items, strength of will, moral fibre.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Flesh aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Hard-boiled: The character's resistance is higher than most and their endurance seems limitless. They can take a lot more punishment than others of the same strength and build. In game terms, the character has 5 additional health points, increasing both their current and total HP.",
    "disadvantage": "Brutish: Violence and excessive force are the character's preferred tools against the Anathema. They tend to use their weapons even when stealth and subtlety would be more appropriate courses of action. In game terms, the GM may force the character to attack a nearby enemy if the group takes too long debating how to handle the situation or devising a plan. This can only be done once per game session."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Hanged Man",
    "past": "An ascetic, a strong moral code, monastic vows, ideals, respecting the law to the point of restricting one's own freedom, a short coma, former paralysis, a sacrifice willingly made, a forced sacrifice, disinterest in society, a healthy body.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Flesh aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Moral code: The character has a moral code that they build their life around. It can be a few short precepts or a strict vow they adhere to. How compatible it is with Avalon's code of conduct is up to the player. In game terms, the PC has one additional lesser motivation (see Step 6: Motivations, on page 127) called 'moral code.'",
    "disadvantage": "Supreme sacrifice: At some point in their life, the character gave up all they had. They no longer have any family or friends, and they may even be living under a false name. Everything they cared about is lost to them, and only their work for Avalon seems to hold any meaning for them now. In game terms, the character has no main motivation."
  },
  {
    "name": "Death",
    "past": "Amnesia, a brutal accident, death of one or more loved ones, a hero without a family, a hero out of nowhere, a new identity, an aged hero.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Mask aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Cheater of death: Death itself seems to not be able to find the character even in the worst of situations, as if they were clinging on to life with all their strength. In game terms, whenever the character is at death's door, they always ignore a 'dead' result on the random injury table and take the next closest injury instead. This advantage can only happen once per mission.",
    "disadvantage": "Veteran: The character is already a grizzled veteran, past the age of 50, with little potential left untapped. They may still have more to learn, but their limits, sadly, have already been set. In game terms, the character may not increase an aspect score beyond 7."
  },
  {
    "name": "Temperance",
    "past": "Miraculous healing, a cured disease, grievous wounds healed, exceptional regeneration, a life spent honing one's body, a life of caring for the sick, life in a place of healing, a healer or doctor, repeated illnesses, an exotic disease, utter neglect of one's body.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Flesh aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Swift healing: The character's metabolism is faster than most. They heal much, much more quickly than others, and bounce back from wounds that would permanently incapacitate anyone else. In game terms, the character regains health points at twice the usual rate. When their wounds are treated with first aid, nanoMs or healing nodes, they add 3 points to the amount of HP restored.",
    "disadvantage": "Immune deficiency: The character's resistance to illness, disease, poison and toxins is almost non-existent. They are at constant risk of infection of all sorts. In game terms, when the character suffers the ill effects of an illness, a poison, or toxins, the GM does not roll for damage; the PC automatically suffers the maximum amount possible."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Devil",
    "past": "A life of excess, base desires that lead to complications, violent reaction to bad consequences, an unsettling bestial attitude, kinship with animals, problems with animals, drugs, alcohol, money spent on harmful things, addiction.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Beast aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Animal instinct: The character's instincts are always awake and sharper than most, giving them advanced warning of things about to happen. In game terms, the PC's initiative gains a +10 bonus when they are ambushed. Furthermore, they retain their defence and reaction scores when they are the target of surprise attacks.",
    "disadvantage": "Bully: The character has all the hallmarks of a bully, acting tough and intimidating whoever they can. Even if they only act this way at the worst of times, deep down, they revel in violence and the suffering it brings. Theirs is a life of simple, destructive pursuits. In game terms, the character's Machine aspect score may never be increased beyond 5."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Tower",
    "past": "Memory loss, a burned village or town, the end of a life, a happy birth, the loss of a loved one, wiping one's past clean, youth, the hunt for experience, a lack of experience.",
    "bonus": "The Tower's bonuses are different from those of other arcana. The character receives no points to allocate to their characteristics. Instead, they receive 2 points to increase their aspect scores.",
    "advantage": "Thirst for knowledge: The character is probably younger than most, and needs to learn as much as they can from their teammates. They may see other Knights of their banner as role models, trying to emulate their skills as best they can. In game terms, once per game session and only when the characters are in Camelot, the PC may undergo training with another PC to increase one of their characteristic scores. Teacher and pupil must spend several hours in intense instruction, focusing on one characteristic. The teacher's characteristic score must be at least 2 points higher than the pupil's. Once they have finished this training period, the pupil may spend half the usual number of experience points to increase the characteristic by 1.",
    "disadvantage": "Amnesia: Whether they woke up in a hospital or were washed up on a beach, the character has no memory of their former life, nobody seems to know who they are, and no records of them exist. They do, however, seem to have a glorious future ahead of them in the ranks of Avalon's finest. In game terms, the GM decides what mysteries lie in the character's background. Furthermore, the player does not choose their character's advantages, letting the GM pick them, and not knowing what they are until they come into play (when the GM chooses to reveal them)."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Star",
    "past": "Prophetic dreams, uncanny luck, a model career, a life of ease, wonderful friends, trust in the future, nightmares, insomnia, success that fuels envy.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Mask aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Prophetic dreams: The character is blessed -- or cursed -- with prophetic dreams. They are aware of the nature of these dreams and, whether they make it known or not, the insight they glean from their slumber often turns out to be useful in some way or another. In game terms, once per game session, when the character is asleep, the player may ask the GM what they see in their dreams. The GM's answer must be cryptic, a couple of evocative phrases about the next part of the mission or one of the main characters at the most. The answer must not intentionally mislead the player or steer them towards false leads (the character can still misinterpret their dreams, though).",
    "disadvantage": "Nightmares: For the past couple of years, after some traumatic event or other, the character's sleep is wracked by nightmares. Their sleep is troubled and they frequently wake up more tired than when they went to bed. (The exact nature of these nightmares is to be decided with the GM.) In game terms, when the character sleeps or rests to heal their wounds, they must roll 1D6. On an even result, everything is fine. The character rests and recuperates as normal. On an odd result, the character's nightmares plague their every attempt to rest. They do not restore any health points, even if they are being treated in Avalon's infirmary, and lose 1 hope."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Moon",
    "past": "Memories buried in one's subconscious, otherworldly dreams, twins, frequent unsettling slips of the tongue, obsessive-compulsive disorders, irrational fears, fear of other people, an illusionist, a held belief that turns out to be false, a lasting lie, a well-kept secret.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Mask aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Professional liar: The character lies through their teeth, and is so good at it that they can make the most outrageous claims sound quite plausible. Though their lies may not be malicious as such, the ease with which they spin falsehoods is the envy of con artists and politicians alike. In game terms, when the character attempts an Eloquence combo Stealth skill check, the difficulty is reduced 1 level.",
    "disadvantage": "Mood swings: The character's mood is a wildly fluctuating, unpredictable thing. Their mood swings can come from a variety of mental or physical issues, but the end result is the same: their state of mind is prone to jumping from happy to sad or from placid to feverish at the drop of a dime. In game terms, once per game session, the GM may pick an emotional state for the character. It can be in complete opposition with the character's mood and actions up until then, and have an effect on their skill checks (at the GM's discretion)."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Sun",
    "past": "A revelation, great joy, a stunning discovery or find, deserved celebrity, justified glory, a truth uncovered, a secret revealed, an educator, a professor, vanity, a desire to appear benevolent.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Lady aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Radiant: The character radiates a natural aura of comfort and encouragement. Their kind words and approving looks drive their allies to surpass their limitations. In game terms, when the character is helped by one or more other PCs, the helpers get +1 die to their skill check. This also applies if a Radiant character uses Heroic Mode.",
    "disadvantage": "Selfish: The character is self-centred, thinking of themselves before others. Their own integrity, their personal glory, and their place centre stage are all overriding concerns, far more important to the character than whatever may befall their allies or anyone else, for that matter. In game terms, the character may never become an adjutant in a heroic mode. Unlike other PCs who would usually be entirely removed from a scene for not helping, however, the Selfish character can still act as normal -- albeit in the heroic protagonist's shadow."
  },
  {
    "name": "Judgment",
    "past": "A good reputation, a bad reputation, demonstrating crowds, a riot, a judicial decision that condemns or pardons, a tribunal, law enforcement, prison, leaving prison, injustice, an audience.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Lady aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Empathy: The character is naturally empathetic. They have a deep understanding of people and are able to detect emotions and moods with little difficulty. In game terms, when the character attempts to determine the state of mind of an NPC or another PC, they receive one automatic success to their Instinct based skill check and can ignore any critical failure results.",
    "disadvantage": "Convict: The character was recruited into Avalon while a prisoner, and is still considered a dangerous convict. To make sure they don't try to escape, Tarasque division implanted a remote-controlled micro-explosive in the character's brain. This allows Avalon to terminate them if ever they step out of line. In game terms, their main motivation must be the following: Win back their freedom. Until this motivation is fulfilled, the character cannot regain hope points by any means. The conditions required to fulfil the motivation are to be decided on with the GM. It could mean going on a number of successful missions, performing a selfless act or sacrifice, and so on."
  },
  {
    "name": "The World",
    "past": "A harmonious relationship, a balanced life, a great project seen to fruition, a completed work of art or architecture, working with nature, working with animals, a scattered life, life-changing misfortune, wounds inflicted by an animal, wounds suffered during a natural disaster, surviving a natural disaster unscathed.",
    "bonus": "The PC adds 1 point to their Flesh aspect, and 3 points to allocate as they choose to characteristics linked to this aspect.",
    "advantage": "Spark of creation: The character is skilled at creating works of art. By some stroke of luck, the spark of creativity never left them. They continue with their artistic endeavours, painting, sculpting, dancing, and making use of their talents for the benefit of Avalon and all Humankind. In game terms, the character spends part of their spare time performing, writing, etc. They add an additional lesser motivation to their list of motivations: Create a work of art. This motivation obeys all usual lesser motivation rules.",
    "disadvantage": "Misfortune Magnet: The character is a jinx, a lodestone for the worst luck possible. Bad luck surrounds them, sometimes only striking the ones close by. In game terms, once per game session, the GM may decide that a failed skill check performed by the PC or one of their allies is a critical failure. If more than one PC chooses this disadvantage, its effects can stack."
  },
  {
    "name": "The Fool",
    "past": "Tainted innocence, costly naivety, children, the insane, a mentally deranged individual, feigned madness, disguised guilt, passing folly, a temporary leave of one's senses, an insane asylum.",
    "bonus": "The Fool's bonuses are different from those of other arcana. The character receives no point to allocate to their aspects. Instead, they receive 6 points to increase their characteristic scores.",
    "advantage": "True Knight: The character is a model of purity. They embody generosity, benevolence, kindness. They are a true Knight, imbued with honour and the firm intent of saving all of Humankind. Their selflessness is without equal. They truly are a hero. In game terms, the character may spend 4 heroism points to enter heroic mode, rather than the usual 6. They can still gain up to 6 heroism points in total. In exchange, they must refrain from villainy -- any act of malice is punished by the loss of 1 heroism point.",
    "disadvantage": "Mental disorder: The PC has a mental disorder that makes life difficult for them. It can be a phobia (blood, crowds, insects, water, closed spaces, disease, etc.) or a compulsive behaviour (pyromania, kleptomania, counting seemingly insignificant details around them, etc.). This disadvantage is mostly meant as a roleplaying tool, but it can sometimes negatively impact the character's skill checks, at the GM or the player's discretion."
